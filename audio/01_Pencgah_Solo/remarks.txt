In this recording Niyazi Sayin, one of the grandmasters of ney, performs 4 taksims and 3 compositions consecutively. The time-intervals are:

Pençgah Taksim: 0 to 113 seconds
Pençgah Peşrev: 113 to 280 seconds
Geçiş Taksim from Pençgah to Pesendide: 280 to 823 seconds
Pesendide Sazsemaisi: 824 to 977 seconds
Geçiş Taksim from Pesendide to Acemaşiran: 977 to 1492 seconds
Acemaşiran Peşrev: 1492 to 1693 seconds
Acemaşiran Taksim: 1693 seconds to end
Note that the second and the third taksims revolves a lot of musical ideas and can be sub-divided into many parts. They are geçiş (transition) taksims from the starting makam to the next one.

During the performance Niyazi Sayin uses a mansur ney, which also implies the ahenk (transposiiton). Nevertheless the first two works have their karar (tonic) note as rast (G4) and the karar of the Acemaşiran makam is the acemaşiran note (F4). Until the end of Pesendide Sazsemaisi the tonic is performed approximately at 403 Hz. Then it shifts to 362 Hz within the performance of 3rd Taksim and stays the same throughout the performance of Acemaşiran Peşrev.
